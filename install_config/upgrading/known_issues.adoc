When upgrading your cluster there are two primary data migrations that take. The
first occurs while still running the current version and the second happens after
the upgrade completes.

If the pre-upgrade migration fails the upgrade will be halted and the admin will
need to resolve any data consistency problems before attempting the upgrade again.
If the post-upgrade migration fails the upgrade will complete and the admin should
investigate the data migration issues as soon as possible. This document will
catalog known data consistency problems and how to resolve them.
